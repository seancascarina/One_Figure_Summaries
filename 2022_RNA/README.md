# Discovering new SR/SR-related proteins using a serine and arginine composition grid search
Serine and arginine (abbreviated "S" and "R", respectively) are two types of amino acid building blocks used to make proteins. Some proteins have unusual parts that have a high fraction of S and R: these regions are called **"RS domains"**, and the proteins that contain them are called **"SR/SR-related proteins"**. These proteins are typically involved in processing the RNA "messages" that ultimately produce all of the cell's proteins. Although previous research had shown that many RNA-processing proteins have RS domains, the search methods used in these studies were limited and incomplete. I developed an algorithm called "LCD-Composer" that can find protein regions like RS domains (i.e., any protein region enriched in one or two amino acids). In the figure below, I show that a simple composition grid search &mdash; which varies the minimum threshold of S and R percentage used by LCD-Composer &mdash; is extremely effective at enriching for these types of RNA-processing proteins. This study greatly expanded the number of known SR/SR-related proteins.
